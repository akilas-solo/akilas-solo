Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Zekarias Solomon, a passionate web and app developer who loves building software that makes a real difference in peopleâ€™s lives. My journey into tech started with pure curiosity and has grown into a career where I get to solve meaningful problems, write clean code, and turn creative ideas into reality.

ðŸ”§ What I Do
I specialize in web development and mobile app development, with a strong focus on tools and frameworks like React, React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, Java, and Python. While I enjoy working across the stack, backend development is where I feel most at homeâ€”itâ€™s where I get to design robust, scalable systems that truly power great software.

ðŸŒ± What Keeps Me Going
Iâ€™m a lifelong learner whoâ€™s always excited to explore new tools and technologies. For me, staying curious and adaptable is key in this rapidly evolving field. I also love collaborating with others and sharing what Iâ€™ve learnedâ€”thereâ€™s something really fulfilling about solving challenges together.

ðŸŒŸ A Few Fun Facts
ðŸŽ¶ Iâ€™m a big jazz and blues fanâ€”music is my go-to for creativity and focus.
ðŸš— Iâ€™m an avid car enthusiast (and Iâ€™m definitely dreaming of a bigger garage someday!).
ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m always looking for ways to blend my passions into my work, whether itâ€™s through creative coding projects or unique problem-solving approaches.
ðŸ’¼ A Few Highlights from My Work
Built a Netflix clone as part of my web development projects.
Developed the Afar National Security Intelligence Information System and a mobile banking wallet app while working with a tech startup.
Contributed to a cafe billing system for Semera University, streamlining operations and improving efficiency.
